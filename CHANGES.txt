=========================
Changes for lovely.recipe
=========================

After
=====

- added the lovely.recipe:eggbox recipe

- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: moved zope recipies into an extra called "zope"
  this requires one to write the extra in the recipe declaraion like
  this lovely.recipe[zope]:<name>

- BIG TODO: add tests for lovely.recipe.zeo and lovely.recipe.zope to
  test and to show what this all is for.

- Added a way to change the owner of created directories.

- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: When creating directories the path used to be
  automatically joined with the buildout:directory. This was removed in favour
  of explicit joining in buildout.cfg.
